# CSU Stanislaus Database Management Systems

The following database was a project I and two of my classmates created for our database class. The theme of our database is around music and helping listeners of music to find more to listen to. The work for the project spanned the entire semester, through many parts, which ultimately ended with us creating a website to display our database.
